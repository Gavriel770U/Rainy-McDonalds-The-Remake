# Rainy-McDonalds-The-Remake
This project is a remake of my old game named `Rainy McDonalds`,
that I have made back in 2019-2020 in Processing3 using Java.
The point of this project is to see how I improved since then,
and how I use the new concepts that I have learnt since then,
like OOP (Classes, Methods, Inheritance, Singletons, Abstraction), 
HitBoxes, Physics, GUI, Terminal, `.bat` and `.sh` files and etc.

The old game was made in one year.
The original concept was taken by my teammate "D",
and I agreed to it, and it was pretty simple and funny to implement this idea in code.
I still enjoy it :D
